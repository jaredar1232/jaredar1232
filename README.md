## Welcome, I'm Jared 

### Some stuff about me
- :bulb: I love learning, specifically getting hyper-fixated until I burn out said new interest  :smiley:

- :octocat: *Hobbies:* Consistent hobbies are traveling(25 countries!), pickup sports & weight lifting, cinematography, and reading... any Sanderson fans?
